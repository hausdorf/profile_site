	<p>
	I'm a <b>Sophomore</b> in <b>CS</b>. My research interests lie mainly in AI and ML, with a specific focus in NLP. I'm spending <b>Summer '11</b> at the <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a> <a href="http://web.jhu.edu/hltcoe" target="_blank">HLTCOE</a>, where I'll work on leveraging compression-based classification schemes (specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_by_partial_matching" target="_blank">PPM</a>) and graph analysis to automate role recognition (<i>e.g.</i>, "who are the evil executives in the Enron emails?", or "find the spammers in the inbox").

	In <b>Fall 2011</b>, I'll be a Junior in CS, supported in part by the Kiri Lou Wagstaff AI Scholarship. I'll also be an RA at <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/" target="_blank">Ellen Riloff</a>'s <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/nlp/" target="_blank">NLP labs</a>.
